Everything to be tuned is in the constants.h file
1. Determine the number of rotations per 100 inches for low and high gear
2. Check and tune 2Ds positioning by changing scrubfactor
3. run drive characterization
4. run PID tuning mode to check ka, kv, ks (PID =0.0)
test on 1 dimensional profile, then repeat on 2 dimensional profile,
5. Tune kAcceleration in Feedforward_only (Feedforward_only set in DriveMotionPlanner.h)
6. Tune NONLINEAR_FEEDBACK values kBeta and kZeta set in DriveMotionPlanner.h and DriveMotionPlanner.cpp
7. Run test profiles selected in the autonomous chooser
