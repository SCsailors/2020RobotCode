1. Increase Accuracy of profile following (Especially left-right)
    -Tune variables
    -improve Spline Generation and add optimization (Bezier or Hermite?)- complete

2. Fix and Clarify Drive encoder outputs- Done

3. Increase Accuracy of positioning -Within 1 or 2 inches
    -Tune variables
    -Higher resolution sensors

4. Add Zeroing of sensors on start up -Completed

5. Update Drive Characterization

6. CTRE/Phoenix.h causes an error when included

7. Geometry, Splines, CSVwriter: inheritance

8. Pure Pursuit?

9. Global definition of pi.

10. determine kAcceleration based on kDriveMaxAcceleration
